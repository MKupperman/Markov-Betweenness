### Abstract
The betweenness centrality of a biological network is important in determining the relative necessity of nodes within the graph topology by considering paths traversing the graph. Here, we examine and compare different notions of betweenness centrality of a transcription–factor–to–target-gene interaction network in the model species, E. coli. This project contrasts two approaches to the betweenness centrality: one considering the geodesic paths between nodes that the node of interest lies on and a biased random walks where the flow of information is not optimal.
